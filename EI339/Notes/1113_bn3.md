## Bayes Nets Representation

- A Bayes net is an efficient encoding of a probabilistic model of a domain
- Questions we can ask:
  - Inference: given a fixed BN, what is $P(X | e)$?
  - Representation: given a BN graph, what kinds of distributions can it encode? 
  - Modeling: what BN is most appropriate for a given domain?
  - *Learning: Given Data, what is the best BN Encoding*

### Size of a Bayes Net
- How big is a joint distribution over N Boolean variables? $2^N$
- How big is an N-node net if nodes have up to k parents? $O(N \times 2^{k+1})$
- Both give you the power to calculate
  - BNs: Huge space savings!
  - Also easier to elicit local CPTs
  - Also faster to answer queries (last lecture!)


## Conditional Independence

- $X$ and Y are independent if
    $$
    \forall x, y \quad P(x, y)=P(x) P(y) \text { - - - } \rightarrow \quad X \Perp Y
    $$
- X and Y are conditionally independent given Z
    $$
    \forall x, y, z P(x, y \mid z)=P(x \mid z) P(y \mid z)---\rightarrow X \Perp Y \mid Z
    $$
- (Conditional) independence is a property of a distribution


### Bayes Nets: Assumptions

- Assumptions we are required to make to define the Bayes net when given the graph:
    $$
    P\left(x_{i} \mid x_{1} \cdots x_{i-1}\right)=P\left(x_{i} \mid p a r e n t s\left(X_{i}\right)\right)
    $$
- Beyond above "chain rule $\rightarrow$ Bayes net" conditional independence assumptions
  - Often additional conditional independences
  - They can be read off the graph
- Important for modeling: understand assumptions made when choosing a Bayes net graph
