\begin{frame}{Conclusion}

In this paper, we further expand the concept and application of individual fairness by improving FAST algorithm. To be specific, we first 

\begin{block}{Our Contributions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Introduce user sets with arrival probability into the original FAST framework, and formally prove the soundness of fairness degree.
    \item Make the FAST algorithm more suitable for online deployment by designing an online algorithm with
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $O(N)$ cost per request, compared with $O(N \log N)$ in Offline-FAST
        \item Making recommendations independent of future requests
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Future Work}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Recommendation for users with diverse arriving probability
    \item Dynamic recommendation results per round from the original algorithm
\end{enumerate}
