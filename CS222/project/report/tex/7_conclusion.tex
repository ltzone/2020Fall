\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we further expand the notion of individual fairness by improving FAST algorithm. To be specific, we first introduce user sets with arrival probability into the original FAST framework, and formally prove the soundness of fairness degree. Next, we make the FAST algorithm more suitable for online deployment by designing an online algorithm with $O(N)$ cost per request, compared with $O(N \log N)$ in Offline-FAST. Its online property will also make the decision process independent of future requests, thus making the algorithm more practical.

Through theoretical analysis and experiments, our work further enhances the practical value and application range of the fairness degree adopted in the FAST algorithm. It is shown that under dynamic user sets and online scenarios, FAST framework can still achieve the purpose of assuring the fairness among users, without losing the recommendation quality. Further work that can be done on the FAST framework includes research into user requests with dynamic arriving probability, or cases where the original recommendation algorithm gives non-uniform recommendation results in different rounds.
